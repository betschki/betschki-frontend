                  <p>
                    I wanted to use some of the skills I have learned in the
                    last two years, to put a simple application together. Right
                    now, you are looking at the application's frontend:{" "}
                    <b>a static site, generated with GatsbyJS</b>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some of the content that you see, is served by a{" "}
                    <b>NestJS backend</b> that is hooked up to a <b>MySQL</b>{" "}
                    database.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Is all of that necessary for a small personal website?
                    Absolutely not. To be quite honest, a simple HTML page with
                    some CSS would have probably been the better option.
                    However, since most of my coding projects are part of my
                    job, I wanted to code something in my free time that I can
                    show publically. So here you are, on an over-engineered
                    personal website ðŸ˜…
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="mt-2">
                    Want to see where I have worked so far?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    You can find my employment history and educational efforts
                    as <b>JSON</b> at the following routes of this website's
                    backend:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <HTTPTag>GET</HTTPTag>{" "}
                    <a href="https://api.betschki.com/employment">
                      /employment
                    </a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <HTTPTag>GET</HTTPTag>{" "}
                    <a href="https://api.betschki.com/education">/education</a>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These API-endpoints are also used within this GatsbyJS
                    frontend to{" "}
